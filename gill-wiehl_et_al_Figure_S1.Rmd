This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
df_by_project_v2 <- read_excel("df_by_project_pub.xlsx")
df_project_overcrediting_v2 <- read_excel("df_project_overcrediting.xlsx")
#df_by_project_v2$protocol_id<-df_by_project_v2$`Row Labels`
df_regress=na.omit(df_by_project_v2)
df_regress <- left_join(df_project_overcrediting_v2,df_by_project_v2)
df_regress <- df_regress[,c('protocol_id','0','total_verified_credits','log_total_verified_credits')]
df_regress <- unique(df_regress)
df_regress <- df_regress[df_regress$total_verified_credits>0,]
df_regress$log_total_verified_credits <- as.numeric(df_regress$log_total_verified_credits)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
